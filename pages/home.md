The core goal of the ICARUS project
is to enable solutions for high bandwidth SatComs in under-served areas for
fleets of vehicles. The design of a comprehensive solution in this context
requires close cooperation between multiple knowledge areas, going from the
physical substrate to the more abstract technologies dealing with application
logic.
