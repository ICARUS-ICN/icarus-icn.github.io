There are some important traffic concepts that are more easily understood when dealing with circuit switched networks than with packet switched ones. One of them is the impact on the overall network behavior of flexible routing of communication requests oblivious to the route length as will probably occur in the new low earth orbit satellite networks that are been deployed nowadays. It is expected that these satellites will be able to use lasers to forward traffic among them, so we are going to explore an academic problem where a guaranteed service with previous allocation negotiation takes place in them. In this paper we present an educational case study designed in such a scenario where students should study the service availability for different configurations as offered traffic increases. Moreover, we have enhanced our simulation tool in order to focus on different blocking probabilities, allowing the aggregation of sample values of traffics with the same blocking probability toward a common mean value estimator. We show results and will be commenting upon the experience as it has been deployed on the current academic year.
