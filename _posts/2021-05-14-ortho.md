Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) techniques have emerged in the past years
as a solution to approximate the throughput performance of wireless
communications systems to their theoretical capacity region.  We consider in
this paper an optimization-based model for multicast device-to-device (MD2D)
communications where the channels are not orthogonal and maybe (partially or
fully) shared among the transmitters in each cluster. This setting leads
naturally to the introduction of NOMA transmitters and receivers who use
successive interference cancellation(SIC) to separate the superposed signals. To
analyze the role of NOMA in MD2D, its performance impact, potential performance
gains and possible shortcomings, we formulate a model that includesSIC
operations in the decoders, so that higher rates can be attained when several
sources transmit on the same channel(s). We also investigate the energy
efficiency of the network (global and max-min)through a dynamic power control
algorithm and present a centralized and a semi-distributed solution to these
optimization problems. Through numerical simulations, we show that NOMA is able
to improve both the sum-rate and the max-min rate of a MD2D network even from a
small degree of resource sharing. Furthermore, these gains also improve the
global energy efficiency on the network,but not always the max-min energy
efficiency of the devices.
