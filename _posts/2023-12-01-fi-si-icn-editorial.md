The great success of the Internet has been essentially based on the simplicity
and versatility of its TCP/IP architecture, which imposes almost no restrictions
on either the underlying network technology or on the data being transmitted. In
essence, applications built on top of TCP/IP are provided with a point-to-point
channel that can be used to transmit arbitrary information. This approach has
served quite satisfactorily for many years, but it no longer suits some of the
new communication paradigms currently being used on the Internet. Nowadays,
most Internet applications are no longer interested in using a point-to-point
channel to exchange traffic between two endpoints. In contrast, what they really
want is to access information that is available in the other network nodes.
Information-centric networks (ICNs) offer a service where users can directly
obtain pieces of information, regardless of their location. This service is more
suited to current network uses and to support the highly dynamic nature of
mobile networks. Additionally, the legacy point-to-point communication model can
be provided on top of it, if so desired. Named data networking (NDN) is an
implementation of ICN that has emerged as a promising candidate for future
Internet architecture. In contrast to traditional networking protocols, NDN
focuses on the content itself, rather than on its location. NDN enables
name-based routing and location-independent data retrieval. This Special
Issue, titled “Recent Advances in Information-Centric Networks (ICNs)”, aims to
highlight and to present recent advances about different problems related to
using information-centric network architecture. It contains nine high-quality
research papers and one review paper. As usual, the Future Internet journal
standards required that all the submitted manuscripts went through a rigorous
peer-review process. In the following, we will use the authors’ own words to
avoid misinterpretation and to provide a more accurate presentation of the
contributions of each paper.
