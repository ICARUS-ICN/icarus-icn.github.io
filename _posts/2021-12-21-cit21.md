Even though the TCP/IP architecture has served the
Internet quite satisfactorily during its more than forty years
of lifespan, there are doubts about whether this host-centric
paradigm is well suited for the communication patterns of
modern applications. These applications mainly need to get
information pieces without being bothered about where they
are located in the network. Additionally, the lack of both in-
built security mechanisms and proper global multicast support
may also be a symptom of fundamental problems with the clas-
sic architecture. Proponents of the novel Information Centric
Networking (ICN) paradigm assert that the replacement of the
TCP/IP architecture with one based on the information itself
could be the ideal solution to all these problems. However, if
such a replacement ever takes place, it will need the help of
some transition mechanisms, for instance, for the transmission
of legacy IP trafﬁc on top of the new ICN based networks.
In this paper we design and optimize such an open source
IP over ICN transition application using the Named Data
Networking (NDN) proposal as our target ICN network. We
performed several tests that conﬁrm that our prototype is
able to transparently transport IP trafﬁc across a pure NDN
network with negligible packets losses, low jitter, and good
performance.
